# CleverRead
CleverRead is a work-in-progress article website,that doesn't provide news, but provides fun things, with zero to little advertising.
The inspiration for CleverRead was basically me being tired of seeing so many clickbait articles that sound cool. They do a good job at perking interest.
CleverRead plans to provide the same clickbait-type content (you wont believe what these celebrities look like now!) without the clickbait titles, without the "slideshow-style" webpages, and without the clutter-y, slow, ads.

# How will you pay for it?
It's going to be hosted on GitHub pages for free right now, but if I ever deciede to buy a domain, I will probably crowdfund the site. Plus, domain fees are affordable for me, so I could just run it with no revenue. I could launch it, and then crowdfund to cover hosting fees+ poetentially even hiring writers to write interesting articles, graphic designers to make cool ads, etc.

# FAQ
Q: If you're against clickbait-style websites, does this mean you'll never run ads?
A: No, it doesn't. We may run ads, but it will never be more than three apropriately placed ads per page. No popups, no annoying videos, just plain ads.
Q: Who is behind this?
A: Void Frost is currently the ONLY developer of this website. Nobody else, just me. I am also quite a newbie when it comes to website development, and am learning as I go. Please be patient with any code errors or mistakes. Thank you :)
Q: How do I support this website?
A: You can't right now, but I'm thinking Patreon is the way to go. 
Q: Will this ever be a subscription-based site?
A: NO! NEVER! This site will always be free for the public to access. Ad's will be run eventually (most likely).
