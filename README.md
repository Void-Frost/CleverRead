# CleverRead
CleverRead is a work-in-progress article website,that doesn't provide news, but provides fun things, with zero to little advertising.
The inspiration for CleverRead was basically I am tired of seeing so many clickbait articles that sound cool. They do a good job at perking interest.
CleverRead plans to provide the same clickbait-type content (you wont believe what these celebrities look like now!) without the clickbait titles, without the "slideshow-style" webpages, and without the clutter-y, slow, ads.

# How will you pay for it?
It's going to be hosted on GitHub pages for free right now, but if I ever deciede to buy a domain, I will probably crowdfund the site. Plus, domain fees are only like $12/year. I could launch it, and then crowdfund to cover hosting fees+ poetentially even hiring writers to write interesting articles, graphic designers to make cool ads, etc.
